A 2D pixel art action-adventure role-playing game (RPG) inspired by classics like Zenonia and Log Horizon. A 2021 NUS Orbital Project made in Unity by Team 2leafclover.

Shadow is a stress-relieving RPG game with swords and magic.

You play as Rain, a young villager boy who has awakened a special being in his shadow. Rain must learn to use his adventurer skills and with the aid of his shadow, halt the impending threat to the world.
