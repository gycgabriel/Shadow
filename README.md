Many people may have played _Zenonia_, one such action-adventure RPG. Early _Zenonia_ had aesthetics reminiscent of 16-bit JRPGs, but even without stunning graphics, Zenonia was able to captivate players through <span style="text-decoration:underline;">character progression</span> and its <span style="text-decoration:underline;">stress-relieving gameplay</span>.

Others may know _Log Horizon_, a Japanese animation series set in an RPG world. Log Horizon has a wide lore of character classes (archetypes that determine each character’s skills), from <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Western</span> (Guardian, Healer, Sorcerer) to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Japanese-influenced RPG elements</span> (Samurai, Shrine Maiden) each used <span style="text-decoration:underline;">strategically to fulfill different roles in combat</span>.

Combining the two in a never seen before way, _Shadow_ indulges players in a world where they can **relieve stress by beating up enemies** while making their character stronger, and **switch character classes in combat** to instantly enjoy different ways of beating up enemies!

 
*   Build your Character and your Shadow to a unique playstyle
    *   Most games have multiple characters in a party. Our game focuses on one character so the player does not need to level multiple characters and have more time to enjoy the process of growing stronger! 
    *   Your Shadow shares your character’s level and stats, but is an alternative build of your character so you can utilise another character class’s skill tree.
*   Choose among character classes from Western to Japanese RPG elements
    *   Enjoy a variety of class types and skills from 12 different classes, from physical attacker classes like Samurai and magical attacker classes like Sorcerer to tank classes like Paladin and support classes like Enchanter!
*   Dynamic Combat! Change combat style mid-battle
    *   Switch weapons and builds with your Shadow and change your skills in the middle of battle. For instance, change from a melee to a ranged attacker to attack bosses that have close ranged advantage. Or you could buff yourself and debuff the enemies with a supporter class before switching to an offensive class to attack.
*   Challenge Enemy AI Bosses in real time combat
    *   Boss summons minions and fires enemy attacks based on your position.
