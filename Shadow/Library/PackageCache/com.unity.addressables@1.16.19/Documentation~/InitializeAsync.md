# Addressables.InitializeAsync
#### API
- `AsyncOperationHandle<IResourceLocator> Addressables.InitializeAsync()`

#### Returns
`AsyncOperationHandle<IResourceLocator>`: The AsyncOperationHandle for the `InitializationOperation`.  This handle is automatically released after it completes.  

#### Description
Initializing Addressables is a preliminary operation that has the responsibility of setting up the runtime data for Addressables.  Addressables.InitializeAsync creates and executes an InitializationOperation operation.  This operation does the following:
- Sets up the `ResourceManager` and the `ResourceLocators`.
- Loads the `RuntimeData` that Addressables built in the Editor.
- Executes `InitializationObjects` operations that were added to the Addressables build. 
- Loads the `ContentCatalog`.  Optionally checks for updates to the `ContentCatalog`.  By default this check is turned on.

You can manually initialize Addressables, though it is not required, by calling `Addressables.InitializeAsync()`. 

If Addressables is not manually initialized, by default Addressables checks that initialization has occurred.  If the initial call, such as a `LoadAsset` request, detects that initialization has not occured then an `InitilizationOperation` is kicked off automatically.  The LoadAsset operation is chained behind the initialization operation and executes automatically afterwards.

By default Addressables sets up an `ExceptionHandler` in the `ResourceManager` for any exceptions that get logged.  An exception handler can be setup manually by assigning a custom handler to `UnityEngine.ResourceManagement.ResourceManager.ExceptionHandler`.  It is also possible to turn off runtime exception logging in the `ResourceManager` by unchecking the box `Log Runtime Exceptions` on the `AddressableAssetSettingsObject`.

```
//Manual initialization
IEnumerator Start()
{
    AsyncOperationHandle<IResourceLocator> handle = Addressables.InitializeAsync();
    yield return handle;
    
    //...
}
```
Manual initialization can have performance benefits on your initial load.  If you know you will use Addressables and don't want to incur the cost of initialization on your first Addressables operation, calling this manually can be a potential solution.

It may be preferable to manually initialize Addressables for debugging purposes.  Lazy-initialization through a chain operation can muddle errors and make the root of the problem unclear.  Manual initialization keeps that process separate which can help narrow down any issues.  

The `Result` of this operation is an `IResourceLocator`.  This object contains a list of Addressable keys and a method that can be used to gather the `IResourceLocation(s)` for a given key and asset type.  

Access to the `Result` or `Status` is only available in a `Completed` callback.  If a yield return is used instead, the Addressables will have auto-released the handle by the time access is attempted. 

Full API documentation can be found [here](xref:UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Initialization).

#### InitializationObjects
These are `ScriptableObjects` that can be added to an Addressable build to bootstrap some operation as part of Addressables initialization.  For example, the `CacheInitializationObject` is provided by default.  If one of these objects is created and added to the AddressableAssetSettings object, under Initialization Objects, it can be used to automatically setup `Cache` settings at runtime.

Custom Initialization objects can be implemented and created by creating a class and inheriting from [`ScriptableObject`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html) and implementing `IObjectInitializationDataProvider`.
